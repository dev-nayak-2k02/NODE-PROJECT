## Introduction

This repository contains a Node.js project built with a focus on modularity, performance, and ease of contribution. The goal is to provide a template or starting point for developers looking to build RESTful APIs, microservices, or full-stack applications.

It leverages **Express.js**, integrates common developer tools, and demonstrates best practices for code organization, testing, and deployment.

Whether you are just starting with Node.js or looking for a structured project scaffold, this repository can serve as a foundation for your application.

---

## Features

* **Express.js framework** for robust API handling.
* **Environment-based configuration** for flexibility.
* **Middleware-driven architecture** for maintainability.
* **Integrated ESLint & Prettier** for consistent code style.
* **Jest testing framework** with unit and integration tests.
* **Docker support** for containerized deployment.
* **Logging & error handling** baked into the core.
* **Scalable folder structure** to support growth.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= 16.x)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for containerization)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
cd project-name
npm install
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and adjust values as needed:

```env
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/project-db
JWT_SECRET=supersecretkey
```

### Running the Project

Start the server in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Start in production mode:

```bash
npm start
```

---

## Usage

Once the server is running, the API will be available at:

```bash
http://localhost:3000/api
```

You can test endpoints using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or `curl`.

Example request:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "uptime": 10234,
  "timestamp": "2025-08-20T10:00:00Z"
}
```

---

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

* `npm run dev` – Start the app with nodemon.
* `npm start` – Run the app in production.
* `npm test` – Run all tests.
* `npm run lint` – Check code style.
* `npm run lint:fix` – Fix linting issues.
* `npm run build` – Build the project for production.

---

## API Documentation

### Health Check

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/health`
**Description:** Returns server status and uptime.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "uptime": 2345,
  "timestamp": "2025-08-20T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Users

* **GET /api/users** – Fetch all users.
* **POST /api/users** – Create a new user.
* **GET /api/users/\:id** – Get user details.
* **PUT /api/users/\:id** – Update user info.
* **DELETE /api/users/\:id** – Remove a user.

More API details can be found in the `/docs` folder or via Swagger (if enabled).

---

## Testing

We use **Jest** for testing. Tests are located in the `tests/` folder.

Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

---

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

Build and run the Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t project-name .
docker run -p 3000:3000 project-name
```

### Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Cloud Deployment

You can deploy to any platform that supports Node.js, such as:

* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
* [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/)
* [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Port already in use:** Change the `PORT` in `.env`.
* **Database connection error:** Verify your `DB_URI` is correct and MongoDB is running.
* **Permission denied errors:** Run commands with proper permissions or use Docker.
* **Nodemon not found:** Install globally with `npm install -g nodemon`.

---

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use Yarn instead of npm?**
Yes. Just run `yarn install` and use equivalent Yarn commands.

**Q: How do I reset the database?**
Drop the collections manually or run `npm run db:reset` (if available).

**Q: Is TypeScript supported?**
Currently, this template is in JavaScript, but a TypeScript branch is under development.
